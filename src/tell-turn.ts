// A turn opened by a delivered bot-to-bot tell must not send one.
//
// The owner's relay tooling puts a deliver-or-drop card in front of them; the
// tap posts a signed relay whose payload opens with TELL_MARK. Claude bots
// refuse a tell inside such a turn with a PreToolUse hook that reads their
// transcript. gpt has no hooks, so it keeps a marker file in its state dir
// for the turns that are RUNNING right now, and the owner's CLI reads it
// before posting a card: {"turns": {"<message id>": <until, epoch seconds>}}.
//
// Tied to the turn, not to a clock: the first cut armed a 20-minute window
// at dispatch, and a human asking gpt to tell someone two minutes after a
// tell had been answered was refused (Jeff 2026-09-15: "it shouldn't be
// blocking on this"). Each entry still carries a safety expiry so a crash
// mid-turn cannot leave gpt mute forever.
